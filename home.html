                <h1>I'M COMING BOSSSSSSS</h1>
                <p>It's time to go to work but you're late! You have to go to work as fast as possible but be careful, 
                    you have to navigate through a maze of obstacles and find your way to safety! Use objects in the 
                    bedroom to figure out how to unlock the door and make it to the office on time. The clock is ticking, 
                    and your boss isn't known for their patience.</p>
